   <h3>About Jed</h3>
   <p>A few days after Thanksgiving 2019, I had a discussion with my good friend over a round of bowling. We caught up on our lives and debated over emerging software technologies to create the next innovative business. Afterwards, he asked me, "How come you don't work in software?" That was a great question! I could not answer it. Software is the past, present, and future. Most of my friends are also software engineers, and they mention the intricate problems they must unravel. I enjoy solving problems and optimizing solutions, so why not!? Thus, I started my journey to learn software. I have been learning Python and Javscript since December 2019.</p>

   <p>I have a BS Chemical Engineering degree from UC Berkeley and MS Engineering and MBA degrees from San Jose State University.
   From the hardware industry, I have extensive experience in managing projects and engineers, overseeing operations, developing products, optimizing processes, defining product specifications, performing QA and reliability tests, and interfacing with international contract manufacturers.</p>

   <h3>Marriott Search Project</h3>
   <p>Marriott Search was the second large project I created. It uses mainly Python and CSS.
   </p>
   <p>Main features:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Form input is sent to Marriott.com with a separate thread. </li>
      <li>The results are scraped using the Selenium framework and sent to a provided email.</li>
      <li>Daily results can be requested by inputting a number in the Email Frequency box. The job is scheduled with the APScheduler Python library with Django.</li>
      <li>Search results are stored in a Postgres database. The previous searches can be retrieved and deleted.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>#30days30projects</h3>
   <p>#30days30projects is a challenge to complete 30 projects in 30 days. I participated because I thought it was a fun approach to improve my front-end skills including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The process was fun. Ultimately, I was successful in completing 30 projects in 30 days.

   <br>
   <h3>#30days30projects Rules</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Create a project per day.</li>
       <li>A project could be an app, a component, a website, a game, a library, etc.</li>
       <li>Your choice of langauge and framework.</li>
       <li>The project is considered complete for the day by 11:59PM.</li>
       <li>Missed projects must be made up within 7 days.</li>
